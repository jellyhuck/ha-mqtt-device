# ha-mqtt-device

A thin Python library for creating and maintaining [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) devices that are discoverable via [MQTT device discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery). Individual entities associated with a device can be added, updated, and removed through the same API.

## Features

- **Device discovery**: publish the discovery payload Home Assistant needs to automatically pick up your device over MQTT.
- **Entity management**: add and maintain multiple entities (sensors, switches, binary sensors, etc.) that belong to a device.
- **Thin and focused**: no heavy framework — just the abstractions needed to model a device and its entities.

## Requirements

- Python 3.14+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for development and dependency management

## Usage

TODO: add examples.

## Development

This project is managed with `uv`. Common commands:

| Task          | Command                        |
